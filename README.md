# Terminal Hacker

Armed with your trusty computer and your hacking skills, you set off to
infiltrate systems across the world. Guess their correct passwords and
improve your Hacker Score. The quicker you gain access to a system, the
more your score will increase. But you better hurry, or you'll be locked
out!

### About this Game
This game is Section 2 of [Unity 3D Developer](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse2/learn/v4/overview)
by GameDev.tv on Udemy. The new features that I implemented were:
+ User naming: Players can give a unique username identifier at the start
of the game
+ Hundreds of passwords: There are over 800 potential passwords for players
to decrypt
+ Scoring system: Players gain points for decrypting the passwords quickly,
but lose points each time they guess incorrectly.

### Potential New Features / To-Do List
+ Achievement System?
+ Special Events/Holiday Levels
